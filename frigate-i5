    # As an example: if you wanted to go from 24 hours to 30 minutes that would be going

  #threshold: 30
  # Optional: The percentage of the image used to detect lightning or other substantial changes where motion detection
  #           needs to recalibrate. (default: shown below)

  # a doorbell camera.
  lightning_threshold: 0.8
  # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: shown below)
  # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will
  # make motion detection more sensitive to smaller moving objects.

  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)

  frame_alpha: 0.01
  # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 100)
